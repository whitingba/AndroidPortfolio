    <li>C.R.U.D. Masters aka Customizable Residence Upkeep Database was built with the homeowner in mind. The homeowner can now maintain household tasks in one place with the ability to assign tasks to household members.</li>
    <li>My role was both front and back-end development as well as the GitHub Repo Master for our project. I was charged with setting up the models and CRUD routes, particles.js for the homepage, and completed the UI for the Edit Tasks page.</li>
