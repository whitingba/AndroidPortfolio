    <ul>
    <li>Denver Lease Connection was developed to allow landlords to display properties they have for rent and for only viable future tenants to be able to view them. </li>
    <li>My focus was to be able to add new listings, have them displayed on the screen and be able to edit the listing for the landlord. I also coded the Google oAuth as well as making it compliant with a Heroku deployment. </li>
    <li>Technologies used: React, Reactstrap, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node.js, Express, Heroku, Google oAuth, ChatKit, GitHub</li>
</ul>
