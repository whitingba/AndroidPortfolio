<p>Ladies of Tea is the brain child of myself and a friend of mine who have a great love for tea. Our first stage is to list all the tea houses and
    cafes in the Denver Metro area. From there we want to start visiting all the tea houses and reviewing them. Last we want to review local tea company's teas as well as tea products. This website
    and logo will be designed by Barbara Whiting. I am currently learning how to use Illustrator so I can build our logo.
    <br>
    Ladies of Tea is set to be deployed Summer of 2020.
